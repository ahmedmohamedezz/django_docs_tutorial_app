# Development Notes

- the dev. server that runs after `python manage.py runserver` command should only be used before deployment

- projects vs. apps
  - apps are web applications that does something (blog app, poll app, ...)
  - project is a collection of (config + apps) for a particular website
  - project contains multiple apps, and an app can be in multiple projects

- use `include()` to include urlConf of other apps
